# tissue_Instrumentation (in progress)
UMN-UW tissue instrumentation code repository

To use code:

0 - Open forcePlotter4.pde code with Processing (32 bit)

1 - Make sure force tongs device is plugged into computer

2 - Look at plot to make sure computer is receiving input data from force tongs

3 - Type desired file name; press enter keyboard or "o" enter button on GUI screen (in progress; user input is taken, but file not renamed yet)

4 - Click green "Start" button to begin recording force data to a text file

5 - Click red "Stop" button to stop recording data

6 - Stop running code from Processing window when done




Sarah's notes:

This is Sarah's first edit to the readme file

Reminder: edit Processing code directly (can edit main branch directly) in GitHub folder on local machine, then save, then commit in github app, then push changes from local machine to everyone on github repo

Notes for using Processing code:  
Check that device is plugged in, ask for user to input file name for new data set, etc.

*Can code save multiple sets of data if user types a new file name in-between sets? If not, fix.
