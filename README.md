# tissue_Instrumentation (in progress)
UMN-UW tissue instrumentation code repository

This is Sarah's first edit to the readme file

Note to Sarah: do not need to use an external editor for code <-> github

Reminder: edit Processing code directly (can edit main branch directly), then save, then commit in github app, then push changes from local machine to everyone on github repo


Notes for using Processing code:  
Check that device is plugged in, 
Ask for user to input file name for new data set, 
Etc
